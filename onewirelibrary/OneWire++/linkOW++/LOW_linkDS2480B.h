/** Link class for DS2480B Serial 1-Wire Line Driver with Load Sensor.

    DS2480B features:

    - Universal, common-ground serial port to 1-Wire line driver for MicroLAN applications
    - Works with all iButtons and MicroLANcompatible 1-Wire slave devices
    - Communicates at regular and Overdrive 1- Wire speed and serial port data rates of
      9600 (default), 19200, 57600 and 115200 bps
    - Supports 12V EPROM programming and stiff 5V pullup for crypto iButton, sensors and EEPROM
    - Load sensor to terminate the stiff pullup as the energy demand of the crypto iButton drops
    - Self-calibrating time base with  5% tolerance for serial and 1-Wire communication
    - Slew rate controlled 1-Wire pulldown and active pullup to accommodate long lines and
      reduce radiation
    - User-selectable RXD/TXD polarity minimizes component count when interfacing to 5V based
      RS232 systems or directly to UARTs
    - Programmable 1-Wire timing and driver characteristics accommodate a wide range of MicroLAN
      configurations at regular speed
    - Smart protocol combines data and control information without requiring extra pins
    - Compatible with optical, IR and RF to RS232 converters
    - Low cost 8-pin SOIC surface mount package
    - Operates over 4.5V to 5.5V from -40캜 to +85캜

    The DS2480B is a serial port to 1-Wire interface chip that supports regular and Overdrive speeds.
    It connects directly to UARTs and 5V RS232 systems. Interfacing to RS232C ( 12V levels) requires
    a passive clamping circuit and one 5V to 12V level translator. Internal timers relieve the host
    of the burden of generating the time-critical 1-Wire communication waveforms. In contrast to the
    DS9097(E) where a full character must be sent by the host for each 1-Wire time slot, the DS2480B
    can translate each character into eight 1-Wire time slots, thereby increasing the data throughput
    significantly. In addition, the DS2480B can be set to communicate at four different data rates,
    including 115.2 kbps, 57.6 kbps and 19.2 kbps with 9.6 kbps being the power-on default.
    Command codes received from the host s crystal controlled UART serve as a reference to continuously
    calibrate the on-chip timing generator. The DS2480B uses a unique protocol that merges data and
    control information without requiring control pins. This approach maintains compatibility to
    off-the-shelf serial to wireless converters, allowing easy realization of 1-Wire media jumpers.
    The various control functions of the DS2480B are optimized for MicroLAN 1-Wire networks and support
    the special needs of all current 1-Wire devices including the crypto iButton, EPROM-based Add-Only
    Memories, EEPROM devices and 1-Wire Thermometers.

    This class is thread-safe.

  /** Send Single Bit command.
  
      The Single Bit command is used to generate a single time slot on the 1-Wire bus at the speed
      indicated by bits 2 and 3. The type of the time slot (Write-0 or Write-1) is determined by the
      logic value of bit 4. A Read Data time slot is identical to the Write-1 time slot. Bits 0 and 1
      of the response byte transmitted by the DS2480B at the end of the time slot reveal the value
      found on the 1-Wire bus when reading.

      For a time slot without a subsequent strong pull up, bit 1
      of the command must be set to 0. For a time slot immediately followed by a strong pullup bit 1
      must be set to 1. As soon as the strong pullup is over, the device will send a second response
      byte, code EFh (read 1) or ECh (read 0), depending on the value found on the 1 Wire bus when
      reading. The strong pullup directly following the single bit is used in conjunction with the
      crypto iButton.

  /** Send Pulse command.
  
      The Pulse command serves several functions that are selected by the contents of bit 1 and
      bit 4 of the command code. The main functions are generating a strong pullup to 5V and
      generating 12V programming pulses for EPROM devices (if the 12V are available at the VPP pin).
      The secondary function of the pulse command is arming and disarming a strong pullup after every
      subsequent byte in Data Mode.

      The arm/disarm function is controlled by bit 1 of the command code. Bit 4 determines whether
      the device will generate a strong pullup to 5V or a 12V programming pulse. The table below
      summarizes these options.

      <pre>
      BIT 4 | BIT 1 | FUNCTION
      ======+=======+==================================
       0    | 0     | strong pullup to 5V and disarm
      ------+-------+----------------------------------
       1    | 0     | 12V programming pulse and disarm
      ------+-------+----------------------------------
       0    | 1     | strong pullup to 5V and arm
      ------+-------+----------------------------------
       1    | 1     | 12V programming pulse and arm
      ------+-------+----------------------------------
      </pre>
      
      The strong pullup to 5V is required to program EEPROM devices or to operate special function
      devices that require a higher current for a limited time after having received a  go and convert
      command. Therefore and because it significantly reduces the effective data throughput on the
      1-wire bus, the strong pullup is disarmed most of the time. Although arming or disarming is
      simultaneously possible while generating a programming pulse, this is not recommended since
      it is likely to destroy the DS2480B if non EPROM devices are connected to the 1 Wire bus.

      The duration of the strong pullup or programming pulse is determined by configuration parameters
      and ranges from a few microseconds over  dynamic  duration (strong pullup only) up to unlimited
      (see section Configuration Commands). However, unlimited duration is not allowed in conjunction
      with arming the strong pullup after every byte. As long as the DS2480B is in Command Mode the
      host may terminate a strong pullup or programming pulse prematurely at any time by sending the
      command code F1h.

      The response byte is generated as soon as the strong pullup or programming pulse is over (either
      because the predefined time has elapsed, the high current demand is over, or due to termination
      by the host). The response byte mainly returns the command code as sent by the host, but the 2
      least significant bits are undefined.

      If the strong pullup is armed and the device is in Data Mode, the end of the strong pullup will
      be signaled as code F6h if the most significant bit of the preceding data byte on the 1 Wire bus
      is a 1 and 76h otherwise. The host will see this response byte in addition to the response on the
      data byte sent.

      The Search Accelerator Control command is used to set or reset the Search Accelerator control
      flag. Bit 4 of the command code contains the state to which the accelerator control flag is
      to be set. If the flag is set to a 1 (on) the device translates every byte received in Data Mode
      into a 12 bit sequence on the 1-Wire bus. Before activating the Search Accelerator, one must
      make sure that the strong pullup after every byte is disarmed (see Pulse Command). The Search
      Accelerator command does not generate a command response byte.

      Although the Search Accelerator Control command itself does not generate any 1-Wire activity,
      it can be used to select the communication speed on the 1-Wire bus. The speed selection
      (if different from the previous setting, e.g., from a Reset command) will take effect immediately.

  /**
      @name DS2480B configuration commands
      The DS2480B is designed to be configurable for the varying requirements of its application.
      When the device powers up and/or performs a master reset cycle, the hard wired default
      configuration settings take effect. These settings will work on a short 1-Wire bus and assume
      regular 1-Wire communication speed. To change these default settings and to verify the current
      settings, the logic of the DS2480B supports configuration commands. A summary of the available
      configuration parameters, their default settings at regular and Overdrive speed and their
      applicability is shown in Table 3.

      Parameters not related to the communication speed on the 1-Wire bus specify the duration of the
      12V programming pulse, the duration of the strong pull up to 5V, the threshold current of the
      load sensor for  dynamic  strong pullup duration, and the baud rate on the interface that
      connects the DS2480B to the host.

      The remaining three parameters are used to modify the 1-Wire communication wave forms if one
      selects  Flexible Speed.

  /** Set the Pulldown Slew Rate Control.
      
      The numbers given Pulldown Slew Rate Control are nominal values. They may vary to
      some extent and are almost independent of the load on the 1-Wire bus.

      Whenever the DS2480B begins pulling the 1-Wire bus low to initiate a time slot,
      for example, it first turns off the weak pullup current IWEAKPU. Then, at regular
      and Overdrive speeds it will generate a falling edge at a slew rate of typically
      15V/ms. This value is acceptable for short 1-Wire busses and adequate for
      communication at Overdrive speed. For MicroLAN networks of more than roughly
      30 meters length one should always use flexible speed. One of the parameters that
      is adjustable at flexible speed is the slew rate of DS2480B initiated falling
      edges.

      As extensive tests have shown, MicroLAN networks at a length of up to 300 meters
      will perform best if the fall time tF is in the range of 4  0.5 ms. This translates
      into a slew rate of approximately 1V/ms. If the actual measured fall time is longer
      than the target value, one should use a value of 1.37 V/탎 or higher. If the fall
      time is shorter, one should use a value of 0.83 V/탎 or lower.
